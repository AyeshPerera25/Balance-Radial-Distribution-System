# Balance-Radial-Distribution-System-Fault-Analyser

Developing a user-friendly software tool, which can be used to analyze faults in a balanced radial distribution system defined by the user. This is a extended project of Developing a Software tool for Load Flow Analysis in a Radial Distribution System. For developing the software, Visual Basic used to develop the front end part and Python used to develop the back end fault calculation part.
