# Balance Radial Distribution System Fault Analyser

Developing a user-friendly software tool, which can be used to analyze faults in a balanced radial distribution system defined by the user. This is a extended project of Developing a Software tool for Load Flow Analysis in a Radial Distribution System. For developing the software, Visual Basic used to develop the front end part and Python used to develop the back end fault calculation part.

#Scope:

•Limit to balanced radial distribution system

•Limit to the system from the Grid Substation
outgoing bus bar down-to the pole point

•Initialize the system using already developed
load-flow analysis tool and expand the tool for fault
analysis

#Background:

•The software has been developed by
using Visual Basic & Python

•Fault analysis has been done by using
the symmetrical component
method

•The impedance bus matrix method
has been used for the calculation

•Both symmetrical and
unsymmetrical faults are analyzed
